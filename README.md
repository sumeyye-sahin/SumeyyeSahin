# Hi there 😇

Sümeyye here, I'm a computer engineer.

I've been recently delving into mobile app development. I'm working on Android applications with Kotlin, and I'm sharing a few of them here. You can also find projects from React-Native.

My previous endeavors were focused on computer vision with Python, and you'll find some projects related to that as well.

Good Job 🙌🏻
